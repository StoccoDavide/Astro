# Astro

`Astro` is a library for orbital mechanics and spacecraft dynamics. This is a refactored version of the [original library](https://github.com/ebertolazzi/Astro) developed by Enrico Bertolazzi (University of Trento, Department of Industrial Engineering).

## Installation

### Quick and dirty

`Astro` is a header-only library that depends only on [`Eigen`](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) (version >= 3.4.0), so the quick and dirty way of installing it is by simply copying the `include` directory to your project and make sure to have [`Eigen`](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) available however you see fit. Alternatively, you can do things properly and use `CMake` (version >= 3.14).

Optionally, you can also install [`Sandals`](https://StoccoDavide.github.io/Sandals) ODEs/DAEs C++17 integrator library, and [`Matplot++`](https://alandefreitas.github.io/matplotplusplus/) (version >= 1.2.0) to plot the results of your simulations.

### CMake

If you are using CMake, you can add the library as a subdirectory in your project.

```cmake
add_subdirectory(path/to/Astro)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE Astro::Astro)
```

You can use `FetchContent` to download the library from GitHub.

```cmake
include(FetchContent)

# Optionally specify a custom path to fetch content to
set(FETCHCONTENT_BASE_DIR "path/to/your/dependencies")
fetchcontent_declare(
  Astro
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/StoccoDavide/Astro.git
  GIT_TAG        main
)
fetchcontent_makeavailable(Astro)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE Astro::Astro)
```

If you already have `Astro` somewhere on your system, you can use `find_pacakge` directly.

```cmake
# Optionally specify a custom path to find content from
list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "path/to/your/dependencies")
find_package(
  Astro
  ${YOUR_DESIRED_ASTRO_VERSION}
  NO_MODULE
)

target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE Astro::Astro)
```

Since we are nice people, we also show you how to conditionally use `FetchContent` based if you already have the library or not.

```cmake
# Optionally specify a custom path to find content from
list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "path/to/your/dependencies")
find_package(
  Astro
  ${YOUR_DESIRED_ASTRO_VERSION}
  NO_MODULE
)

if(NOT TARGET Astro::Astro)
  include(FetchContent)

  # Optionally specify a custom path to fetch content to
  set(FETCHCONTENT_BASE_DIR "path/to/your/dependencies")
  fetchcontent_declare(
    Astro
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/StoccoDavide/Astro.git
    GIT_TAG        main
  )

  fetchcontent_makeavailable(Astro)
endif()

target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE Astro::Astro)
```
